# Multi-Faction DAO
A DAO used to govern a game which contains multiple factions. Each faction gets one vote and that vote is determined by how members of that faction vote. Each faction is represented by a specific token id/type in an ERC-1155 contract. The contracts are based on OpenZeppelin's Governor contract, and make the necessary adjustments to use ERC-1155 tokens for voting.
